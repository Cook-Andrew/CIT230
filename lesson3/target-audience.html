            <h2>Target Audience:</h2>
            <h2>Persona 1:</h2>
            <h3>Barbara "Barbie" Millicent Roberts</h3>
            <p>Barbie has over 200 careers, and as such is always busy. She primarily looks at the weather on her phone
                for a quick update to the weather so she knows how to dress and what to prepare for traveling between
                jobs. She is a prominent member of the community and it's no secret that she likes pink. The website's
                color scheme was designed with her in mind. This persona represents short term planning and quick mobile
                visits.</p>
            <h2>Persona 2:</h2>
            <h3>Kenneth "Ken" Sean Carson</h3>
            <p>Ken is an athlete. In order to schedule time to go on dates with his very busy girlfriend, he has to plan
                his schedule weeks in advance. He looks at the long term weather forecasts to plan whether he should be
                a lifeguard, or schedule an indoor soccer game. Ken doesn't often check his phone because he is so
                involved with physical activity. He generally checks the forecast on his laptop. This persona represents
                long term planning, and extended desktop visits.</p>
            <h2>Scenario 1:</h2>
            <p>An old man is visit from out of state. He checks the weather (and prints it out) for his upcomming
                vacation</p>
            <h2>Scenario 2:</h2>
            <p>A woman checks her smart phone in the morning to decide whether to bring an umbrella with her to work.
            </p>

            <h2>Scenario 3:</h2>
            <p>A family checks emergency updates because of an upcoming tornado.</p>

            <h2>Scenario 4:</h2>
            <p>A soccer team is preparing for their final game. They check the weather to see if there's a possibility
                rain and thunder will cause it to be rescheduled.</p>

            <h2>Scenario 5:</h2>
            <p>Ken, the neighborhood's most wealthy extrovert, is planning a big pool party. He checks the forcasted
                temperature to determine whether his guests will use his indoor or outdoor pool. </p>
