          While it may be better to call it "Yellow Space" in this case, this website exemplifies clean design. There is
          only once function you absolutely need to listen to the radio: a play button. It's reasonable for the company
          to want to place their logo, and a now playing ribbon to the screen as well. That's it! Three elements is all
          the website needs.

          Visual Hierarchy

          CNN <br>

        <p>
          Through the use of h1 through h3 headers, CNN is able to create a visual hierarchy. Just based off the
          boldness of the words I am able to tell the designer thought that the title was most important, the subtitle
          was next most important, and the related articles are the least important. The words "breaking news" do not
          follow the header pattern but you can tell that they are also important because of the red background. The
          logo and the menu are the smalled elements on the screen. Despite the related articles being the least
          important as individuals, as a group they take up the most space and subtly become most important element
          because the news agency wants you to spend more time on the website. Their goal, after all, is conversion.

        <h3>
          Fitt's law
        </h3>
        <p>
          Amazon <br>
          <a href="https://amazon.com/" target="_blank">https://amazon.com/</a></p>
        <img src="/CIT230/lesson2/images/amazon.png" alt="screenshot from mobile site">
        <p>
          Ignoring the dorky title for the wishlist I created for my wife to buy me Valentine's day presents, this list
          demonstrates Amazon's strong use of Fitt's law. The most important button for profits is "Add to Cart" which
          is largest and in the center of the screen. The next most important button for making money is "+ invite".
          While
          this button doesn't directly translate to a sale like the previous example, this button attracts new customers
          to look at the product. It is slightly farther away from the center, but it is quite large compared to other
          buttons on the screen. "View Lists" is tiny and the far top of the screen. This button is necessary for
          function, but will not make the company any money, so they put it out of the way.
